# Training Flutter App (app/)

This folder will contain the training Flutter application built with QA-friendly best practices:
- Clean Architecture (presentation / domain / data)
- deterministic UI selectors using `ValueKey`
- predictable states for testing (loading/error/empty/success)

## Goal
Learners can run the app locally and understand where to add:
- screens/widgets
- use cases
- repositories/data sources

> Note: This repository currently provides a scaffold. The next step is generating the Flutter project (`flutter create`) and implementing the app features (Login + CRUD) with heavy in-code comments.
