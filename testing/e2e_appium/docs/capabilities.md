# Appium Capabilities (Android) — EN

> This is a training scaffold. We will pin exact values once the app package name is finalized.

## Minimal capability fields
- platformName: Android
- automationName: Flutter
- deviceName: emulator
- app: path to APK (debug)

## Notes
- Prefer installing the app once and using appPackage/appActivity for faster runs.
- Keep capabilities in `src/config/capabilities.android.ts` (or `.mjs`).
