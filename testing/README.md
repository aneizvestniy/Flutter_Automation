# Testing (testing/)

This folder contains everything needed to set up and run tests:

- `unit_widget_integration/` — Flutter test strategy, coverage, and examples.
- `e2e_appium/` — Appium 2 + appium-flutter-driver setup and E2E framework (Page Objects, fixtures, etc.).
- `ci/` — GitHub Actions workflows and CI notes.

## Milestone
By end of Week 2: first runnable E2E test (login flow, 5–7 steps).
