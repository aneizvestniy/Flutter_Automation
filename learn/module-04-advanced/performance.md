## Goal
Teach QA engineers *what to measure* and *how to avoid misleading metrics*.

## Minimal example metrics
- cold start time (approx)
- frame jank spikes during navigation

## Tools
- Flutter DevTools → Performance
- `flutter run --profile` for more realistic performance

## Acceptance criteria
- Learner can capture a performance timeline and point to jank
