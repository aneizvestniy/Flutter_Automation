# Module 02 — Training App (Week 1–2)

## Goal
Build a simple but realistic Flutter app that is:
- easy to understand for QA engineers
- designed for testability (Keys, predictable UI states)
- structured using Clean Architecture

## Required features
- Login screen
- CRUD feature (Notes or Tasks): create/list/update/delete
- Navigation flow: login → list → details/edit → back → logout

## What learners should be able to do by end of Week 2
- Run the app locally
- Understand where features live (presentation/domain/data)
- Identify stable selectors (`ValueKey`)
- Complete their first E2E test using Appium + flutter driver

## Exercises
