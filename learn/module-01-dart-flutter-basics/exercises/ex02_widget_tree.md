# Exercise 02 — Widget Tree mindset

## Goal
Build intuition for how Flutter composes UI and how it impacts automation.

## Task
1) Run the app (Module 2) and open **Flutter DevTools**.
2) In **Widget Inspector**, locate:
   - the login button widget
   - a list item widget (CRUD feature)
   - a text field widget
3) For each element, write down:
   - its widget type (e.g., `ElevatedButton`)
   - its `ValueKey` (if any)
   - the parent widgets (2–3 levels up)

## Acceptance criteria
- You can explain why the widget tree is not the same as a DOM.
- You can locate elements using DevTools and confirm keys.
