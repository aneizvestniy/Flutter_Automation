# Module 01 — Examples

These examples are intentionally small and heavily commented.

They are designed to be copied into the training app later, or used as reference while you read the main app code.

- `keys_demo.dart` — how and why to use `ValueKey`
- `widget_tree_demo.dart` — how widget composition works
- `state_demo.dart` — state changes and why tests need synchronization
